<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
  You need a DirectX February 2010 or newer to run D3D9Client. To install the
  client itself you need to extract the zip package in the root folder of the
  Orbiter. In order to use a graphics client you need to run "Orbiter_ng.exe"
  instead of "Orbiter.exe". Also the client must be activated from the Modules
  tab.
</p>

<hr />
<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<h1>DirectX Runtimes</h1>
<p>
  If the redistributable package isn't installed in your computer you will
  receive an error message "The program can't start because d3dx9_42.dll is
  missing from your computer". Or you may see a pop-up window in Orbiter
  LaunchPad telling about a missing runtimes. If that happens then download and
  extract the content of the package in any empty directory you want and then
  find a Setup.exe and run it. You can delete the contents of the directory
  after the setup is completed. The directory is just a temporary storage for
  the installation files.

<h1 id="_junctions">Orbiter Sound 3.5, Spacecraft3.dll</h1>
<p>
  In order to use Spacecraft3.dll and Orbiter Sound (Version 3.5) with an
  external graphics client &ndash;like D3D9Client is one&ndash;, symbolic links
  in <code>/Modules/Server/</code> folder must be created.
</p>
<p>
  Note, that for the current version of Orbiter Sound (Version 4.0) the "Sound"
  link is not necessary anymore. It will not be created via the according Button
  in D3D9Clients "Advanced Setup" dialog, if D3DClient detects that the loaded
  Orbiter Sound Module if of Version 4.0. Anyhow, it does not harm if the
  "Sound" link is present for a Orbiter Sound 4.0 setup.
</p>
<p>
  The two symbolic links in <code>/Modules/Server/</code> folder for
  <code>Config</code> and <code>Sound</code> folders point (or link) to their
  "originals" located in the root folder of the Orbiter installation.<br/>
  If you are using Windows XP or newer and your installation is on a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS" target="_blank">NTFS</a>
  filesystem, these links can easily be created from Video Tab -&gt; Advanced
  Setup. If you have problems with creating the links you can also use a
  software called Link Shell Extension (see link below) or you can simply copy
  the <code>Config</code> and <code>Sound</code> folders into
  <code>/Modules/Server/</code>. But then you have to keep them updated
  manually.

</p>

<hr />
<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<h1 style="page-break-before:always;">Fullscreen Mode and Alt-Tabing</h1>
<p>
  D3D9Client doesn't support alt-tabing in a so-called "True Fullscreen Mode".
  Therefore, it's recommended that you use a windowed fullscreen mode that will
  run the orbiter in a fullscreen sized borderless window. There is also a
  conflict between a GDI based dialog (i.e. pop-up) windows and anti-aliasing
  in a true fullscreen mode which will disable the anti-aliasing.
</p>

<hr />
<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<h1>D3D9Client Advanced Setup</h1>
<p>
  Under the regular Video Tab of the Orbiter (Orbiter_NG) Launchpad you find
  the "Advanced" Button that will show the "D3D9Client Advanced Setup" Dialog.
  Here you can change several settings to tweak your experience with the
  D3D9Client.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <img title="D3D9Client Advanced Setup" src="images/D3D9Client%20Advanced%20Setup.png" alt="D3D9Client Advanced Setup" />
</blockquote>
<p>
  On the lower left side of the Dialog you'll find the "Create symbolic links"
  button that will create the symbolic links that are needed for some add-ons.
  The symbolic links can only be created on an NTFS filesystem, so if you have
  installed your Orbiter installation for example on an FAT32 of extFS
  filesystem this feature will not work. In this case you have to copy the
  according folders as explained in the "<a href="#_junctions">Orbiter Sound,
  Spacecraft3.dll</a>" chapter.
</p>

<h2>Surface texture load options</h2>
<p>
  Here you can change the behavior how the D3D9Client will load surface
  textures. The two options available are either "Load on demand (recommended)"
  or "Pre-load at session start":
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load on demand (recommended)</li>
    <p>
      With this recommended option selected the D3D9Client will only load
      surface textures when they come into view while you are orbiting a
      planet. The value in the "Max. load frequency [Hz]" input field lets you
      tune the maximum frequency the D3D9Client will check whether some new
      surface textures have come into view.
    </p>
  <li>Pre-load at session start</li>
    <p>
      With this option selected the D3D9Client will load all surface textures
      at startup of a scenario which results in a longer loading time.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2>Graphics options</h2>
<p>
  Here you can change settings according to your graphic hardware:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anti-aliasing</li>
    <p>
      Depending on your hardware you can select the anti-aliasing feature that
      will "smoothen" the visual artifacts that occur when displaying edges.
    </p>
  <li>Anisotropic filtering</li>
    <p>
      Depending on your hardware you can select the level of anisotropic
      filtering. For further details about this topic take a look at
      <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_filtering">Anisotropic
      filtering</a> in the wikipedia.
    </p>
</ul>
<p>
  Following checkboxes can be checked (enabled) or unchecked (disabled) to
  further fine-tune your D3D9Client experience:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-load base visuals at startup</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> the D3D9Client
      will load all base visuals at startup of a scenario which results in a
      longer loading time.
      <br />
      With this option <b><em>disabled</em></b> the D3D9Client
      will only load base visuals when they come into view while you are e.g.
      flying through the atmosphere or orbiting a planet.
    </p>
  <li>Enable advanced texture maps</li>
    <p>
      With this option enabled D3D9Client will try to add additional texture
      information for meshes that supply them. This advanced texture maps
      define for example how "rough" or "shiny" a texture appears.
    </p>
  <li>Enable environment maps</li>
    <p>
      With this option enabled D3D9Client will try to add additional texture
      information for meshes that supply them. This environment maps define how
      "reflective" a texture appears. This reflections can be seen best on
      shiny metal surfaces, which do reflect the "environment" more or less
      mirror-like.
      <p style="text-indent:1em;">Note: This option must be
        <b><em>enabled</em></b> to be able to use the "D3D9 Debug Controls"
        dialogs option which displays the current environment (as a flattened
        cuboid) for debugging purposes.
      </p>
    </p>
  <li>Disable near clip plane compatibility mode</li>
    <p>
      If the near clip-plane compatibility mode is enabled then the minimum
      clip-plane distance is 1.0 meters as is in the Orbiters internal engine.
      If the compatibility mode is disabled then the client can reduce the clip
      distance down to 0.1 meters, if there is a graphics close to the camera.
      This setting will only effect in so-called exterior pass. Virtual cockpit
      near clip-plane distance is defined in D3D9Client.cfg and the default
      value is 0.1 meters.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2>SketchPad settings</h2>
<p>
  The SketchPad is used in Orbiter to draw 2D graphics onto surfaces. These are
  for example MFD Displays or announcements in the Simulation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device to use</li>
    <p>
      The two options you can choose from at "Device to use" are "GDI/DirectX"
      and "GDI Only".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><em>GDI/DirectX</em></b> will use the DirectX 2D
      drawing capabilities of your graphic hardware to draw 2D surfaces.
      Normally this is the recommended setting, because it will not produce so
      much CPU load that the "GDI Only" option.
      <br />
      <b><em>GDI Only</em></b> will only use GDI to draw 2D
      surfaces which might be the option when you experience any glitches or
      graphical artifacts in MFD screens. This mode is used for older graphic
      hardware to be able to run Orbiter.
    </p>
  <li>Font rendering</li>
    <p>
      The four options you can choose from at "Font rendering" are "Crisp",
      "Default", "Cleartype" and "Proof Quality".
    </p>
    <p>
      Each setting will render fonts more smooth but uses a bit more graphic
      hardware performance.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2>Generic configuration</h2>
<p>
  The generic configuration contains options that will change the general
  behavior of D3D9Client. For most of the time the default setup should be fine
  ("Default" Shader set and Debug Level "1").
  But you can for example change the verbosity of the internal logging system
  to be able to report more detailed issue information when you experience an
  error or failure.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shader set</li>
    <p>
      If you have different shader sets you like to switch between, this select
      box lets you choose between them.
      <br />
      Note however, that this option is not always available and strongly
      depends on the version of D3D9Client! The R6 release for example has only
      the "Default" shader set to select.
    </p>
  <li>Debug level</li>
    <p>
      The five options you can choose from here [0...4] represent the level of
      information that will be written into the log-file. The log-file is
      called D3D9ClientLog.html which can be found in
      <em>Modules\D3D9Client\</em> directory. Higher values will create more
      detailed output.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until you have any problems and like to have more detailed information
      what's going on, you should keep this level reasonably low as higher
      values will result in more disk I/O what slows down the Simulation.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2>StereoScopic 3D</h2>
<p>
  The stereoScopic 3D settings allow you to tweak the 3D experience if you are
  using a NVIDIA graphic card that provides this feature.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convergence</li>
    <p>
      The convergence value lets you choose "how far your eyes are apart".
      The default value is 0.2 meters (20 cm / 7.8 inches) which is round about
      the average distance between your eyes. Increasing this value might
      result in a view with "more depth".
    </p>
  <li>Field Depth</li>
    <p>
      In optics, particularly as it relates to film and photography, depth of
      field (DOF) is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a
      scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. In the context of
      Stereoscopic 3D it defines the distance where the relative position
      between the "right eye objects" and the
      "left eye objects" are overlapping exactly and switch their
      position when further away or closer that that "point".
      For further details about this topic take a look at
      <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field">Depth of field</a>
      in the wikipedia.
    </p>
</ul>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<h1 style="page-break-before:always;">D3D9 Debug Controls Dialog</h1>
<p>
  The D3D9 Debug Controls Dialog allows you look at different things while the
  simulation is running.
  <br />
  Such things are for example the highlighting of Meshes or Groups, so their
  location and look can be easily checked. Looking at a complete scene in
  wireframe mode might for example help in finding any mesh parts that are not
  placed correct.
  <br />
  The D3D9 Debug Controls Dialog also allows you to change the settings of
  materials at runtime, so that changes can be 'seen' while changing them.
  <blockquote>
    <img title="D3D9 Debug Controls" src="images/D3D9%20Debug%20Controls.png"
         alt="D3D9 Debug Controls" />
  </blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Mesh debugger</h2>
<p>
  The mesh debugger group contains elements to inspect a mesh. It gives a mesh
  developer some tools at hand to better inspect a mesh in its 'natural
  environment', the Orbiter Simulation environment.<br />
  Whith the options available in this group one can for example separate
  individual parts of the shown scene and leave out all the rest, so it might
  be easier to see what really happens at rendering.<br />
  Other settings change the environment so that the current lighting
  conditions do not apply, so when the mesh is currently in the shadowed part
  of the orbit it can still be seen with some artificial ambient light.<br />
  For all possibilities, please read the descriptions of the individual GUI-
  Elements, below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li id="_display">Display</li>
    <p>
      This combo box lets you select what parts of a scene is rendered. The
      possible options are: "Everything", "Selected Visual", "Selected Mesh" or
      "Selected Group".
      <br />
      <b><em>Everything</em></b> will, as the name suggests, display
      everything. This will show the scene as it will be shown normally when
      running a Orbiter simulation session.
      <br />
      <b><em>Selected Visual</em></b> will display only the currently selected
      visual. Planets and moons for example are excluded.
      <br />
      <b><em>Selected Mesh</em></b> will display only the currently selected
      mesh. If for example two vessels are in the complete scene, only one of
      them will be displayed. All other vessels, planets and moons are
      excluded.
      <br />
      <b><em>Selected Group</em></b> will display only the current selected
      group. This is often just a "part" of a vessels mesh. All other groups,
      vessels, planets and moons are excluded.
    </p>
  <li id ="_camera">Camera</li>
    <p>
      This combo box lets you select the camera-mode. It can be either "Center
      on visual" or "Wheel Fly/Pan Cam".
      <br />
      <b><em>Center on visual</em></b> will select the 'normal' Orbiter camera
      operations where with pressed right mouse button you can 'drag' the
      camera around the current selected visual.
      <br />
      <b><em>Wheel Fly/Pan Cam</em></b> will select another camera-mode where
      with pressed left mouse button you can pan the camera left/right or
      up/down and with the right mouse button pressed it can be 'tilted'.
    </p>
  <li>Speed</li>
    <p>
      This control lets you change the speed of the camera movements when you
      are in "Wheel Fly/Pan Cam" camera-mode (see
      <a href="#_camera">Camera</a>).<br />
      The value is a kind of 'factor' applied to the movement of the mouse (or
      the mouse-wheel). It ranges from 1 (beeing the lowest speed) to 8192
      (beeing <u>very fast</u>).
    </p>
  <li id="_mesh_idx">Mesh Idx</li>
    <p>
      This control lets you select one mesh of a multi-mesh vessel by its
      index. If a vessel consists of a "hull"-mesh and a cockpit-mesh, you will
      be able to select the two meshes individually by selecting the according
      mesh index here.
    </p>
  <li>Group Idx</li>
    <p>
      This control lets you select one group out of the current selected mesh
      (see <a href="#_mesh_idx">Mesh Idx</a>) of a multi-group mesh by its
      index. If a mesh consists of multiple groups, you will be able to select
      the individual groups by selecting the according group index here.
    </p>
  <li>Highlight selected group</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> the current selected group will
      be permanently highlighted (green).
    </p>
  <li>Highlight selected mesh</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> the current selected mesh will
      be permanently highlighted (blue).
    </p>
  <li>Add ambient light</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> the current selected mesh will
      be lit by artificial ambient light independent of the current 'global'
      lighting conditions. The mesh is then not only lit from the sun (lighting
      only parts of the mesh), but from all sides. This also applies to
      situations when the mesh is usually not lit at all, when on the night
      (dark) side of an orbit.
    </p>
  <li>Dual sided</li>
    <p>
      Faces are normally only rendered from one side (the "backside" is kind of
      completely transparent). With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> all
      faces are rendered opaque from both sides.
      <br />
      This option might help developers to identify parts of the mesh that are
      "sticking out" of another mesh-part, that are normally only to be seen
      from the "inside". A cockpit mesh inside a hull mesh can be for example
      much bigger than the hull and it will not be easy to find out, cause from
      the "inside", the hull faces are transparent so the (to big) cockpit mesh
      can be seen. And from the "outside" the cockpit faces are transparent
      although "covering" the hull.
    </p>
  <li>Wireframe</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> the scene (or only parts of it,
      see <a href="#_display">Display</a>) will be rendered as wireframe model.
      In a wireframe model only the edges (the lines connecting vertices) of
      the meshes are drawn. This can be helpful to identify 'useless' parts a
      mesh.
    </p>
  <li>Pick</li>
    <p>
      The Pick option is one of the most useful tools for selecting materials.
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> you can just select a material
      by clicking onto it with the left mouse button.
      <div style="left:5%; position:relative">
      <img title="Pick in action" src="images/PickInAction.png"
           alt="Pick in action" height="20%" />
      </div>
      Whenever a material is picked it will light up in green, so it is easy to
      see which material is chosen. After a material is chosen all the settings
      in the lower part of the D3D9 Debug Controls Dialog apply to that
      material.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2 style="page-break-before:always;">Bounding geometry</h2>
<p>
  The options in this group offers additional rendering of bounding boxes or
  spheres of individual mesh parts.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boxes</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b>, objects of the scene will have
      their bounding boxes also drawn.
    </p>
  <li>Spheres</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b>, objects of the scene will have
      their bounding spheres drawn. The sphere represents the smallest volume
      that still fits the complete geometry.
    </p>
  <li>Selected group only</li>
    <p>
      This is one of three options that let you limit the parts of the mesh
      that are rendered.
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b>, only the currently selected
      <b>group</b> will be rendered.
    </p>
  <li>Selected mesh only</li>
    <p>
      This is the second of three options that let you limit the parts of the
      mesh that are rendered.
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b>, only the currently selected
      <b>mesh</b> will be rendered.
    </p>
  <li>Selected visual only</li>
    <p>
      This is the third of the three options that let you limit the parts of
      the mesh that are rendered.
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b>, only the currently selected
      <b>visual</b> (vessel mesh) will be rendered.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2>Misc.</h2>
<p>
  This group contains some debugging options to assist on more severe problems
  or let you see the current environment, that is used for the environment
  mapping feature of the D3D9Client.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tile debugger</li>
    <p>
      Client development utility/debugger. Unimportant from user point of view.
    </p>
  <li>Identify render target conflicts</li>
    <p>
      Identifies GDI - Render Target conflicts by flashing surfaces in red and
      yellow. These conflicts can cause a major framerate impact.
    </p>
  <li>Display env mapping</li>
    <p>
      With this option <b><em>enabled</em></b> the environment mapping "box"
      will be displayed as a flattened box. This will become a cross-like area
      that shows the environment of each of the sides of that "virtual box".
      <br />
      This box can be imagined as a box with mirror-surfaces which show the
      environment the face of the box 'sees'
    </p>
</ul>

<h2 id="_material_x">Material 'X'</h2>
<p>
  This group contains all the elements that enable you to tweak the different
  parameter of materials.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dissolve effect</li>
    <p>
    This field is used to select a special effect texture for dissolve effect.
    </p>
  <li>Material property</li>
    <p>
  	  <b>Diffuse</b>
  		<p>
  		  Defines diffuse material color [RGBA]. Texture is modulated with this
        color. The range for every property in this section is [0.0 to 1.0]
        unless otherwise noted.
  		</p>
  	  <b>Ambient</b>
  		<p>
  		  Defines ambient material color [RGB].
  		</p>
  	  <b>Specular</b>
  		<p>
  		  Defines specular material color [RGBP]. The last field is a specular
        power from [0.0 to 1000.0].
  		</p>
  	  <b>Emissive</b>
  		<p>
  		  Defines emissive material color [RGB].
  		</p>
  	  <b>Reflect</b>
  		<p>
  		  Defines reflection color [RGB] for a metallic (mirror a-like)
        reflection which intensity is independent from a viewing angle. This is
        also used to define minimum reflection offset for a fresnel reflection.
        Due to some implementation problems a non-zero value must be entered to
        enable fresnel reflections. For a mirror like reflections a typical
        range is [0.0 to 1.0] and for a fresnel reflections a typical range is
        [0.05 to 0.2].
  		</p>
  	  <b>Dissolve</b>
      <p>
        Dissolve is an experimental technique that can be used to create blurry
        or noisy reflections. Currently it can be only applied to non-normal
        mapped surface that has a texture. It would be possible to use a
        screen-space coordinates to create a similar effect to a non-textured
        materials as well. The first field is the effect scale factor (i.e.
        particle size). The second field is the effect strength. If either
        parameter is zero the effect will be disabled. This property requires
        dissolve effect texture.
      </p>
      <b>Fresnel</b>

  		  The first field in fresnel parameters is a power value. A typical range
        for the power is [2.5 to 4.5]. The power value will effect in a viewing
        angle dependency of the reflection. The second field is a multiplier.
        It will define a maximum reflection intensity when viewed from a
        shallow angle. This value must be zero to disable fresnel reflections
        otherwise a typical range is [0.8 to 0.95].

<h2>Save materials (<i>Button</i>)</h2>
<p>
  The <b><em>save materials</em></b> button in the "D3D9 Debug Controls" Dialog
  does just that: it saves the materials ;)
  <br />
  Once you are happy with the result you have adjusted in the
  <a href="#_material_x">Material 'X'</a> group, click on "save materials" and
  the changed material specifications will be saved in the
  <code>Config\GC\</code> folder of your Orbiter installation.
  <br />
  Then of course you can tweak these file(s) in <code>Config\GC\</code> folder
  with notepad etc.
  <br />
  So next time you fly with a ship of the same class it will have the
  properties, you have defined or changed, applied.
  <br />
  If you want to have the "default" look back, just delete the according file
  from that folder (e.g. <code>Config\GC\DeltaGlider.cfg</code>) and the
  standard Orbiter appearance will be restored.
  <br />
  The install ZIP of D3D9Client contains some of those files already, that
  contain some nice "advanced looks" for some of the standard vessels. You can
  always take those and place it back into that folder to get the
  "D3D9-Default" look.

<h1 style="page-break-before:always;">Base Configuration settings</h1>
<p>
  The D3D9Client allows you to to configure some more details when settings up
  runway lights.
  <br />
  Additionally to the parameters that Orbiter itself defines (see
  <em>Doc\OrbiterConfig.pdf</em> for further details) there are some extra
  parameters you can define.
  <br />
  For a better understanding how some of those parameters will affect the
  rendering of the runway lights this image might help:

<div style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">&lt;RUNWAYLIGHTS&gt;</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>&lt;END1 V&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      First end point of runway (center line).
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;END2 V&gt;</strong></li>

    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;WIDTH F&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Runway width (m)
      <br />
      Note: Two different light configurations exists (wide&gt;59m) and
      (narrow&lt;59m)
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;PAPI F F F I I&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).<br />
      Parameters:<br />
      Designated approach angle (deg)<br />
      Approach cone aperture (deg)<br />
      Offset of PAPI location from runway endpoints. (m)<br />
      PAPI Mode (int:0-3) (this is optional parameter)<br />
      PAPI runway end point (int: 0-1) (if this parameter is not defined then
      PAPI is added in both ends)<br />
      <br />
      PAPI Modes:<br />
      0: On center line<br />
      1: On left side<br />
      2: On right side<br />
      3 or none: On both sides<br />
      <br />
      PAPI Endpoint:<br />
      0: PAPI lights added to END1 only<br />
      1: PAPI lights added to END2 only<br />
      Not Defined: PAPI lights added in both ends<br />
      <br />
      Note: Runwaylights can have 12 PAPI lights. Orbiter's inline engine will
      ignore the last parameter. If more than one PAPI entries exists in the
      runwaylights the inline engine will only use the last one.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;VASI F F F I&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI).<br />
      Parameters:<br />Designated approach angle (deg)<br />
      Distance between white and red indicator lights (m)<br />
      Offset of VASI (red bar) location from runway endpoints (m)<br />
      VASI runway end point (int: 0-1) (if not defined then VASI is added in
      both ends)<br />
      <br />
      Note: Runwaylights can have 2 VASI lights.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;TD_DISP F&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Touch Down displacement (m). (default: 0m)<br />
      Displacement between runway endpoint and the green line.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;TD_DISP2 F&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Touch Down displacement for the other end of the runway (m).
      (default: 0m)<br />
      Displacement between runway endpoint and the green line. If this value
      isn't specified then TD_DISP is used for both ends of the runway.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;TD_LENGTH F&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Length of the Touchdown zone (m). (default: 600m)<br />
      Two columns of lights on a runway each containing 3 parallel lights.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;DECISION_DIST F&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Length of the "red lights" zone (m). (default: 257m)<br />
      This zone contains 2 x 3 x 9 red lights and the spacing between lights
      will depend about the length of the zone. The touchdown zone will use the
      same spacing about 30m.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;APPROACH_START F&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Length of the approach lights from the green line (m).
      (default: 900m)<br />
      It's the long column of 5 parallel lights.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;SINGLEENDED&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      If the singleended keyword is defined then the lights are only rendered
      when approaching a runway from END1 towards END2. If you want a
      asymmetric runwaylights then you need two runwaylight sections in a base
      configuration file.
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;CATEGORY&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Defines the category of runway lights. 1 = SSALR, 2 = ALSF-II, If this
      value isn't specified then the category is automatically selected based
      on a runway width. ALSF-II is used if the width is greater than 59m.
    </p>
</ul>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<h1 style="page-break-before:always;">Advanced Texture Maps</h1>
<p>
  Additional texture maps can be automatically assigned for a mesh simply by
  placing additional textures into a texture folder. Additional textures are
  identified by using an identifier in the end of the textures name like
  "dgmk4_1_bump.dds" where "dgmk4_1.dds" is the name of the base texture.
</p>
<p>
  A fully specified texture set could for example consist of these files:
  <pre>
    cube.dds       &lt;= 'base' texture
    cube_bump.dds  &lt;= 'advanced texture Bump-map'
    cube_spec.dds  &lt;= 'advanced texture Specular-map'
    cube_emis.dds  &lt;= 'advanced texture Emission-map'
    cube_refl.dds  &lt;= 'advanced texture Reflection-map'
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  Available identifiers are:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li id="_norm"><strong>&lt;_norm&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Tangent space normal map and the valid formats are:<br />
      <br />
      &lt;R8G8B8&gt; 3-bytes per pixel. Best quality (uncompressed)<br />
      &lt;V8U8&gt;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;2-bytes per pixel. Good quality (uncompressed)<br />
      &lt;DXT1&gt;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;1-byte per pixel. Bad quality (compressed)<br />
      <br />
      V8U8 offers the best quality for 2-bytes per pixel. This format can be
      created with nVidia texture tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong style="color:red">Note:</strong>
      The configuration of this (<em>_norm</em>) identifier is ignored if a
      <em>_bump</em> configuration is also found. However, the <em>_norm</em>
      configuration is the preferred one that should be used when you have the
      choice (see also <a href="#_bump">_bump</a>).
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;_spec&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Specular map controls a specular reflection in per pixel basis.
      Alpha channel is containing a specular power setting. Value 255 is mapped
      to maximum matarial defined power and 0 is mapped to 0.0. Specular map is
      modulated by specular material color. Valid formats are &lt;R8G8B8A8&gt;,
      &lt;DXT3&gt; or &lt;DXT5&gt;.
    </p>
  <li id="_bump" style="page-break-before:always;"><strong>&lt;_bump&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Bump maps are also supported by the D3D9Client. They are automatically
      converted into normal maps during loading of bump maps (see note).<br />
      The <b>recommended</b> formats are &lt;A8&gt; and &lt;L8&gt;:<br />
      &lt;A8&gt; 1-byte per pixel alpha<br />
      &lt;L8&gt; 1-byte per pixel luminance<br />
      <br />
      From the <b>not recommended</b> multi-channel textures only the <b>red</b>
      channel is used; They are:<br />
      &lt;R8B8G8&gt; 3-bytes per pixel (only red is used anyway)<br />
      &lt;DXT1&gt;&ensp;&ensp; 1-byte per pixel compressed<br />
      &lt;R16F&gt;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;2-bytes per pixel (might work, not tested!)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong style="color:red">Note:</strong>
      The configuration using the (<em>_bump</em>) identifier will overwrite
      any <em>_norm</em> configuration in case both identifiers are found. The
      <em>_norm</em> configuration is however the one that should be used when
      you have the choice (see also <a href="#_norm">_norm</a>).
    </p>
  <li><strong>&lt;_emis&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Currently emission map works more like a light map and the simplified
      equation is:
      <pre style="font-size:9pt;">pixel_color.rgb = texture.rgb * clamp(emission_map.rgb +
                                      sun_light.rgb + local_lights.rgb)</pre>
      Alpha channel is ignored therefore the recommended formats are
      &lt;R8G8B8&gt; or &lt;DXT1&gt;.<br />
      The exact implementation would require some discussion with an add-on
      developers to define the function for the emission map. An other
      possibility is:
      <pre style="font-size:9pt;">pixel_color.rgb = texture.rgb * clamp(sun_light.rgb + local_lights.rgb)
                + emission_map.rgb</pre>
      Of course, the clamp function can be changed to a different kind of
      color curve manipulation function to control contrast and lightness.
    </p>
      <li><strong>&lt;_refl&gt;</strong></li>
    <p>
      Reflection map controls material reflectivity and color in a per pixel
      basis. Fresnel reflection works independently from a reflection map.
      However, a zero (black) reflection map value will mask off the fresnel
      reflections as well. A non zero value will apply full fresnel reflections
      for that pixel. Only [RGB] channels from a texture are used.
